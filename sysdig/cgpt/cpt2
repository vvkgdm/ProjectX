Based on your setup, youâ€™re running Azure DevOps (ADO) pipeline agents as KEDA-scaled pods in a Kubernetes cluster (cluster1, namespace1) and each pod name starts with agent11.

Your goal is to:

Alert when more than 35 ADO agent pods are running in parallel, AND

These pods have been running for more than 20 minutes

ðŸ“Œ Explanation
Component	Purpose
kube_pod_info{...}	Gets pod metadata, filtered by name starting with agent11
kube_pod_status_phase{phase="Running"}	Filters to only "Running" pods
* on(pod, namespace) group_left()	Joins pod_info and status_phase on pod/namespace
count_over_time(...[20m:1m])	Checks how many such pods have been running for at least 20 minutes
> 35	Triggers alert if more than 35 such pods are running

This ensures that only pods with agent11 prefix, in cluster1/namespace1, and running for at least 20 minutes are counted â€” and the alert fires only when that count exceeds 35.
